career-profile:
    title: Research Profile
    summary: |
      I am interested in \textbf{biomedical data analysis}, particularly in \textbf{cancer diagnostics} and other \textbf{high-dimensional domains} where interpretability and structure are critical. My work draws on tools from [**applied algebraic topology**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00738), [**human-centered machine learning*](https://cacm.acm.org/research/toward-practices-for-human-centered-machine-learning/) (HCML), [**eXplainable AI**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253523001148) (XAI), and applied statistics.
      I was a DST-INSPIRE Research Scholar in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Tezpur University from 2018 to 2024. My research was broadly focused on generating functions, *q*-series, and their combinatorial properties.
